# Startup Evaluator

A simple, interactive web app to rigorously evaluate your startup idea using a framework inspired by Y Combinator's core principles.

## Core Concept

Great startup ideas are not born perfect; they are refined through critical evaluation. This tool digitizes the process of asking the tough questions that challenge an idea's viability from day one.

The entire evaluation framework, including the **4 Common Mistakes**, **10 Key Questions**, and **7 Idea Recipes**, is based on decades of insights and advice shared by **Y Combinator** with thousands of successful founders. It turns their wisdom into an actionable checklist and a reflective workbook.

Instead of just a static list, this tool guides you through a focused, one-question-at-a-time process, forcing deep thought on crucial aspects like **market size**, **founder fit**, and **scalability**.

## Features

- **Guided Evaluation:** An interactive modal walks you through 24 critical data points.
- **Idea Health Snapshot:** A radar chart provides an instant visual summary of your idea's strengths and weaknesses.
- **Action Plan:** Prompts you to list actionable "next steps" for each evaluation point.
- **Downloadable Report:** Generate and download a PNG snapshot of your final report to share with co-founders or mentors.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, dark-themed glassmorphic interface for focused thinking.
